# Puzzle Mission

A place where stakeholders can put all the pieces together.

After seeing a handful of proposals successfully passed on the Enigma mainnet its become painfully obvious the governance experience needs to be made more accessible. While stakeholders currently have access to the information regarding proposals from current block explorers like the one hosted by cashmaney, stakholders still lack a comprehensive resource that allows them to more actively participate in the governance process.

To address this secretnodes.org is working to launch puzzle, an open source project forked from hubble. Once weâ€™ve deemed our fork as stable, we plan to use this as a foundational layer to conduct governance UI/UX experiments and display metrics regarding Secret Nodes. These experiments are aimed at making the process of voting and assessing network performance as easy as possible.

## How to Setup Puzzel in Production

### Provision Host

1. Fork this repo!
1. Provision your host machine
This is tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS.
Install some dependencies for Ruby and Rails.

To make sure we have everything necessary for Webpacker support in Rails, we're first going to start by adding the Node.js and Yarn repositories to our system before installing them.

```
sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs yarn
```
Configure rbenv
Installing with rbenv is a simple two step process. First you install rbenv, and then ruby-build:

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

rbenv install 2.5.1
rbenv global 2.5.1
ruby -v
```
install Bundler
```
gem install bundler
```
Installing Rails
```
gem install rails -v 5.1.7
```

When using rbenv, you'll need to run the following command to make the rails executable available:

```
rbenv rehash
```
Now that you've installed Rails, you can run the rails -v command to make sure you have everything installed correctly:
```
rails -v
# Rails 5.1.7
```

Run this
```
sudo apt install postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```

### Production

1. cd into dir.
```
cd puzzle
```

1. Run the following commands.
```
bundle update
bundle install
```

Generate encrypted secrets with `bin/rails secrets:setup`. Use `config/encrypted_secrets_quickstart.yml` to see what values are needed for what environments. Store `config/secrets.yml.enc` somewhere safe as it won't be committed.
1. Setup your instance:
    ```
    export puzzle_ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
    export puzzle_HOST=ip-or-hostname-of-server
    export puzzle_RAILS_ENV=production
    export puzzle_KEY=~/.ssh/<key-name>.pem
    export puzzle_DOMAIN=<domain-name>
    export puzzle_REMOTE_USER=<username>
    ./setup/bootstrap.sh
    ```
    This automated process is meant for a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS install. We use AWS for this. Puzzle uses HTTPS everywhere, so watch the output for when it asks you to create a DNS record.
1. Assuming that all goes well, there will be a URL you can visit to claim an admin account and setup a password/2FA.
1. In admin, create a new Cosmos chain with the chain name and gaiad RPC/LCD info. Make sure to click 'enable' at the top.
1. Next ssh into the machine, start `screen` and do the initial sync:
    ```
    cd /puzzle/app/current
    bin/rake sync:cosmos:all events:cosmos:all stats:cosmos:all
    ```
    That will take a good long while depending on how long the chain you're syncing has been going for.
1. Once it's done, you will want to install the crontab entries. You can either run `bin/bundle exec whenever --update-crontab` right now, or just deploy again and they'll get installed automatically.

### Development
1. Pull the repo into your local environment
2. Make sure you have Ruby 2.5.1 and bundler 2.0 installed on your local machine. 
3. Run `bundle install` from the project root.
4. Once all gems are installed properly, create the database by running `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate`. `rake db:migrate` might fail the first time but it should succeed on subsequent tries. 
5. run `rails db:seed`. You should get an output with `Admin Created:` followed by a URL. You'll need this in the next step. 
6. run `rails s`. Go to the URL and create a password. 
7. That's it! Your development environment is now set up. 

## How to Deploy

Use the appropriate generated deploy script if you used our setup scripts:

```
bin/deploy-{RAILS_ENV}.sh
```

Or do it manually:

```
RAILS_ENV=staging DEPLOY_USER=puzzle DEPLOY_HOST=ip-or-hostname DEPLOY_KEYS=~/.ssh/puzzle.pem bin/bundle cap staging deploy
```
